<h2>NOTE</h2>

The interface has 2 button for importing. 

"Import new data migration" - This will take a v2 export data file and import it into v3.  You should use this button if it's a fresh import of data. (This is designed to loop and do the import 2 times, so all cross refs for categories and products are correctly created)

"Update existing migrated data" - If you've already imported the data file, you can use this option to redo the import if anything got missed. (Just makes things quicker, becuase in this case we don't need a double loop to link refs)
